Cloud :- it means that your database and other services that your using or providing that are on internet that  service that provide you data through internet that is called cloud service.

cloud 3 type
        cloud app --- saas
        cloud plateform --- ias, pas
        privete cloud --- comp

In cloud there is thos who are using saas and thos who not using cloud but they have to relay on saas by some way

Saas is multi-tenancy
        --> it means shared that server is shared to every coustomers and database are deferent but thos data base can insulated with each other so that cannot mearge(application of saas ensure that)

Saas example :
                --> CRM         ERP         Email     Storage       Productivity
        Salseforce  CRM
        Oracle      cx cloud    cloud ERP
        SAP         Sales Cloud Cloud
        Microsoft  365 Sal      365 finance ----------full 365 we are using----
        Google                              ----------Google work space--------
        Apple                               iCloud------------
        Dropbox                                        Dropbox
        mega                                            MEGA Storage
        etc...      ...         ...         ...         ...         ...

            this is an example of comp that are providing saas

Evaluation SaaS  user
**********************
Advantages : 
            Faster Development  -> no local installation require(if you want you can customize)
            Usage Payment       -> Low cost
            Less financial risk -> if your bussness is going then you pay more and use more(free trial)
            Reduce primices     -> don't need workers 
            No mantainance      -> you dont have to patch anything like os update for windows or linux

Disadvantages:
            - Requires trusting a SaaS provider -> for availability and security
            - Can rise legal/regulatory concerns -> your using saas that may have been located outside of youe country so you may feeding the data that is importent to country outside of borders
            - Can limit customization -> multi-tanancy so you cannot do much of customization
            - Can be harder to integrate -> this is hard somtime
            - Can have lower performance -> it can sometime take more then you think like amazone stop running for 1 or 2 second then that may cause the some tranzation faillur that can cost money issues 

***********************
Saas: Software vendors
***********************

Advantages :
            - Can provide more revenue stream -> This is like mantainance service you have to pay for every month to use so it is more stable source of money then licance
            - Direct sell -> This can sold Direct to business decision makers so you dont need staff
            - Low cost ->  this is distributed system so you dont have to play whole price
            - More knowlage -> you can see your app using by coustomers
            - New customers -> its online so every can find you and test your application then purchase the service so its like (પહેલા વાપરો પછી વિશ્વાસ કરો - નિરમા)
            
Disadvantages :
            - You have to purchase the software before try 
            - more slow revenue from saas vendors
            - less customization for software
            - new sales challenges (if user is not cloud friendly)
            - New change in pricing and sales

********************************************
Impact of SaaS
            - Batter user access you don't have to install try before buy.
            - For software vendors is different like pricing and everything else.

Main part The Big Picture

 Cloud plateform Technologies:
 
  Compute (1)
 infrastature as a services (IaaS) -> user can create and use virtual machine
 Plateform as a serveices (PaaS)->  application run on supporting services 

 Compute(2)
 Containers as a services (CaaS) -> Kubernetes "user can deploy and run in Containers"
 Function as a Services (FaaS) -> user can create all services as function and invok that functions

 DATA (3)
 Virtual machineobject storages
 Relational storage
 NoSqul Storage
 

 **********************
 Private Clouds
 ***********************

 That storage that pre excist in organization and that store on internet that is not cloud
 (you must have to services link to your database or cloud some implemention has to be there)
 like : Iaas, PaaS

 Three public cloud technology 
1. prem Server deployment Like : AWS Outpost, Azure Stack
2. Cloud for IOT Devices: AWS IoT Greengrass, Azure IoT Hub
3. Edge Computing

1. Azure Stack Hub --> This take all azure take servie and make it availabe in Enterprices(locally).
    This is Miscrosoft Azure's code
    You have to purchase togather with hardware from organization like hp or dell
    Change Organization for mantainanc(Organization Management)

2. AWS IoT Greengrass --> just like previous this aws also give all services to the green-grass and make it available to Enterprices(locally - private server)
    This is for IOT -- For Consumers
    This use Faas(Lambda)  function as setvies (main***)
    Messaging between green-grass devices

    This is green-grass this look to the fuature 

3. Edge Computing --> involves some compution into on-prem devices
                        - This give more speedy perfomance for Example If your connection with server is slow then you have to wait for the responce
                        - So for real-time responce for iot device it inherit the services from cloud to locally for personal faster usage
                        - This is probably private cloud

************************
Impact of private coud
************************
- This make your local on-prim world batter 
- public cloud and private cloud is hybrid cloud the main gole for today
- private cloud is slow market
- private cloud give real value
- it provide mordan application solution

 Infrastature for aws

 infrastature.aws 
    Region
        Availability Zone
            Edge Location
                
**/ Building own data center

    Capitalized Expenditure (CaPEX)
    This expance is for your Building, Servers, and supporting equipment

    Oprating Expenditure (opEx)
    This expance is of On going connectivity, utility, maintenance cost

(this cost but somtime use get dinied access to the application because of fix data center capacity)

**/ Cloud data center with same application

    In this there is application load and your usage Cloud give you cost that based on your usage.

(Your data center is variable so your user have full access to your application all the time)

**/ Financial implications
    Manage your own data center
        Large invesment
        Potential under Capacity or Unmet Demand
        Increasing Capacity Take time because of you have to buy all the things
        Monthly Cost will be on infrastature
    
    Leverage Cloud Infrastature
        No invesment
        You pay for that you use
        Capacity can add immediately
        Monthly cost based in user demand
